This is a repository for the final research paper and its numerical simulation scripts written by Laura Hu and Mia Prim. 
This research paper was written under the guidance of Prof R. Carretero at SDSU and was graded as the final project of the graduate-level course Discrete Dynamical System and Chaos. 
_The actual paper is uploaded as a pdf file_ and the rest are all numerical simulations in Python scripts. 

Abstract: 

 This paper reviews a recent modification proposed to the Nicholson-Bailey model, which introduces a nonlinear
 dependence of parasitoid search efficiency on their density. This adjustment allows for more realistic population dynamics
 and the potential for local asymptotic stability. The model is further extended by incorporating spatial heterogeneity,
 which highlights the impact of spatially variable growth rates on host-parasitoid dynamics. This spatial variation
 disrupts uniform population behavior, leading to localized dynamics, spatially dependent coexistence mechanisms, and
 increased system complexity. The findings of this study provide a more robust and biologically relevant model for
 host-parasitoid interactions, contributing to the broader field of population biology and biological control


Note:

The basin of attraction is incorrect, the corrected version should be produced by both 'basin of attraction' python code in the repository. The images are shown below:
